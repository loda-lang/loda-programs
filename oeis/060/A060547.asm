; A060547: a(n) is the number of patterns, invariant under 120-degree rotations, that may appear in a top-down equilateral triangular arrangement of closely packed black and white cells satisfying the local matching rule of Pascal's triangle modulo 2, where n is the number of cells in each edge of the arrangement.
