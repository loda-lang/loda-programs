mov $1,$0
seq $0,3056 ; n appears n+1 times. Also the array A(n,k) = n+k (n >= 0, k >= 0) read by antidiagonals. Also inverse of triangular numbers.
mov $3,3
pow $3,$0
mov $4,3
mov $0,1
seq $1,2262 ; Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = k, 0 <= k <= n, in which row n lists the first n+1 nonnegative integers.
