; A075643: Group the natural numbers so that the n-th group contains n numbers one each of a multiple of numbers from 1 to n so that the group sum is a multiple of (n+1): (2), (1, 8), (3, 4, 9), (5, 6, 12, 32), (7, 10, 15, 16, 30), (11, 14, 18, 20, 25, 24), ... Sequence gives initial terms of groups.
